# Permit-Management-System

A simplified backend system where users (e.g., store owners) can:

- Register and log in

- Submit a permit application (e.g., refrigeration permit)

- View status of submitted applications

- Admins can approve/reject applications

# Contact List Manager

A full-stack web application to manage a list of contacts using a simple and modern UI. This project allows users to **add**, **search**, and **delete** contacts. The application is built using **React** for the frontend and **Node.js/Express** with **SQLite** for the backend.

The project follows a modular folder structure, separating concerns such as components, API calls, and styles, making the codebase clean and maintainable.

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React (Functional Components + Hooks)
- Axios for HTTP requests
- CSS for styling
- React Testing Library & Jest for testing

### Backend
- Node.js + Express.js
- SQLite (via `sqlite3` and `sqlite` npm packages)
- RESTful API with structured routing

---

## Features

-  Add a new contact with name and email
-  Search contacts by name or email
-  Delete existing contacts
-  Responsive and modular UI components
-  Unit testing setup for frontend functionality
-  Concurrent dev server setup to run both frontend and backend simultaneously

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/contact-list-manager.git
cd contact-list-manager
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

#### Backend:

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

#### Frontend:

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

#### Root:

```bash
cd ..
npm install   # for concurrently
```

### 3. Start the Application

Run both client and server together from root:

```bash
npm start
```

* Frontend available at: `http://localhost:3000`
* Backend API available at: `http://localhost:3001/contacts`

> This setup uses `concurrently` to run both React and Express servers in parallel.

---

## Running Tests

To run the frontend test suite:

```bash
cd client
npm test
```

* The tests cover basic UI rendering and interaction logic.
* API calls are mocked via the modular `api/contacts.js` file.

---

## Design Decisions & Trade-offs

* **SQLite was chosen** for simplicity and quick setup. Since it's a file-based DB, it requires no additional installation or configuration. This is ideal for small-scale applications and take-home projects.

* **No authentication** was implemented to keep the scope focused on contact CRUD functionality. In a production app, you would likely want user accounts and protected endpoints.

* **Custom CSS was used** instead of external UI libraries like Tailwind or Material UI. This gives full control over layout and design while keeping dependencies minimal.

* **The project was modularized** to improve code readability and separation of concerns. API logic, components, and styles are placed in their own folders.

* **The backend does not use any middleware like CORS or proxying** because the frontend uses full URLs (e.g., `http://localhost:3001/contacts`) to access the backend. This avoids proxy configuration but hardcodes the port for local development.

* **Environment variables (`.env`) were not used** since all backend URLs are currently handled directly via constants in the API layer. In a production setup, using environment variables would make this more flexible.

---

## Future Improvements

*  Add Edit/Update functionality for contacts
*  Improve mobile responsiveness and accessibility
*  Add user authentication with JWT/session support
*  Add better client-side and server-side input validation
*  Add loading indicators and error UI states
